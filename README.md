Dotfile configurations

# vim
for all of my vim files

Step by step guide for myself on how to get back to where I am if I swap computers:

get colemak, run file for registry changing capslock to backspace

Get Git bash and setup Git (SSH key)

Add gvim to path

Get Vundle

coc, requires node.js and visual studio c++ tools, when complete, if javascript error, call :call coc#util#install()

install python3 and add to path

install mingw for C and C++

install jdk

make sure all this is added to path

should have choco by now run choco install make to get make

Then you can make universal-ctags
